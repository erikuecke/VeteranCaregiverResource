This app gives any U.S. servicemember, veteran, their caregiver, family member or advocate access to a comprehensive list of over 2,000+ federal, state, and NGO resources compiled by U.S Dept of Veteran Affairs. The range of resources include: 
	
	* Health, 
	* Benefits & Compensation
 	* Housing
    * Education & Training
    * Employment
    * Family & Caregiver Support
    * Transportation & Travel
    * Homeless Assistance
    * Other Services & Resources 

Veteran Caregiver Resource app peforms a get request to the Veteran Affairs API, downloads and parses a JSON file into a persistant Core Data database. The user can initially filter through all the resources for a specific subject, then search through all the titles, description and subects of that filter. Once the resource is found, the user can see the details of that resource, go to the resource website, save it to a persistent list of saved resource and then share it with anyone through textmessage, email or social media.
